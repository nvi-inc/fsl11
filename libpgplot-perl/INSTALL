These packages do not form part of FSLinux 11 per se, but are supplied as a
courtesy for those who really want to use the non-free PGPLOT library instead
of its free replacement giza.

Note that they will be summarily overwritten should libpgplot-perl undergo any
security-related upgrade unless you pin them in APT to prevent that.

To install:

  apt install pgplot5
  dpkg -i libpgplot-perl_2.24-1+b2+anu0_{amd64,i386}.deb


NB: Use of these packages is at your own risk.
